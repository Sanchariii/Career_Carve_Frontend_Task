# CareerCarve_Frontend_Task
 

# Introduction:


This is a frontend task is given by CareerCarve which states that:
A user can manage the names, order and presence of sections on their resume using this Resume Builder page.

There is a master list of sections allowed on the resume. This list is shown in the design. The user can perform some actions mentioned below.

# Actions:

1. Drag drop the section to indicate the order in which the sections should be shown on their resumes. Animation is required to show the user which section is being moved where button should be used to drag drop.

2. An edit button allows the user to change the name of the section.

3. The toggle button allows the user to switch a section on or off enabling the user display/ not display that section on the resume.

4. The save button should be enabled only if the user has changed something.

5. Clicking on button shows a description of the section.

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

* npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

* npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\


* npm run build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!



* npm run eject

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
